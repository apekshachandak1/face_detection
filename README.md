# Face Detection App

This **Face Detection App** is built using **Streamlit** and **OpenCV**, designed to offer users a range of image processing capabilities, including face detection, smile detection, eye detection, and image enhancements. The app also includes artistic transformations like cartoonizing and edge detection (Canny).
